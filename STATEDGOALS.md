I want this application to enable users, such as myself, the ability to optimize the use of their AMC Stubs A-List membership.

I want users to be able to:
    * be able to see specified movies in the shortest total amount of time on a specified day
    * not miss out on movies they wanted to see that have left theatres (have some sort of tracking that assigns a likely_to_leave theatre score or there are probably websites that provide this information - will need an API). So, the application will have to have some function where it specifies prescribed order of viewing to minimize missed movies.
    * Have a no-driving mode where users will not switch malls or theatres and a willing-to-drive mode if more expedient combinations between different theatres (and distances between theatres) permits that is expedient.

Later on:
    * users will be able to specify no-go, acceptable, and preferred seating preferences
        - proximity to screen
        - aisle or middle
        - back or front
        - #spaces required on each side at time of booking (get an alert if the seat they have booked no longer meets that criteria with new bookings and will prompt them the opportunity to switch reservation)
        - Rewards-maxing suggestions
